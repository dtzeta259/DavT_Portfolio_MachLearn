# DavT_Portfolio_MachLearn
Portfolio for CS4375 Machine Learning Class

## Overview of Machine Learning
A summary of machine learning and some of the important element in machine learning.
Access to doc: [Overview_ML](https://github.com/dtzeta259/DavT_Portfolio_MachLearn/blob/main/Overview_ML.pdf).

## Data Exploration
C++ program to reproduce the built-in functions of data statistics in R. A good review for
programming in C++. Access to Code and Doc: [Data_Correlation](https://github.com/dtzeta259/DavT_Portfolio_MachLearn/blob/main/Portfolio_component1/data_exploration_Component1.cpp), [Data_Correlation_Doc](https://github.com/dtzeta259/DavT_Portfolio_MachLearn/blob/main/Portfolio_component1/data_exploration_document.pdf).

## Linear Models
Two R Notebooks created to read and analyze two different datasets via linear regression,
logistic regression, and Naive Bayes models. Once read in, data cleaned, and analyzed, a 
prediction and evaluation of the data is done to see how accurate and varied the data is.

## ML Algorithms from Scratch
Two C++ programs that implement logistic regression and Naive Bayes
algorithms from scratch using the titanic dataset provided.
Access to Code andc Files: [Logistic Regression C++](https://github.com/dtzeta259/DavT_Portfolio_MachLearn/blob/main/Portfolio_component3/LogisticRegression_Part1.cpp), [Naive Bayes C++](https://github.com/dtzeta259/DavT_Portfolio_MachLearn/blob/main/Portfolio_component3/NaiveBayes_Part2.cpp), [ML Algorithms C++ Overview](https://github.com/dtzeta259/DavT_Portfolio_MachLearn/blob/main/Portfolio_component3/ML%20Algorithms%20from%20Scratch%20Overview.pdf)

## Simularity Algorithms
A series of algorithms done as part of a team assignment (Team 12). Utilizing several algorithms
to test a dataset including: Regression, Classification, Clustering, and Dimensionality Reduction.
I was assigned the clustering sections for this component. The clustering R Notebook will use
three methods of clustering to obtain the most optimal model: K-means, Hierarchical, and Model-based.

## Ensemble Data
Series of learning algorithms that improve the accurracy and the mcc (Matthew's correlation coefficient), which are Bagging, Random Forest, AdaBoost, and XGBoost. For this one, Random Forest and AdaBoost is used out of the four ensemble learning algorithms.

## ML with Sklearn
A Python Notebook created in Google Colab, demonstrating how Python is used in Machine
Learning, using the sklearn, Numpy, seaborn, and pandas libraries.

## Image Classification
Python Notebook created in Google Colab, which implement image classification of a image-based dataset using
Keras. Using a satellite image dataset, several different models are implemented to predict whether the image 
is of the water or not. These models are: Sequential, Convolutional Neural Network, and Transferred Learning.
