Portfolio Component 1: Data Exploration

This program will read the Boston.csv file and reproduce some of the same functions
as the built-in functions in R Studio. There are 7 functions in total, with six of them 
calculating the following statistics: sum, mean, median, range, correlation, and covariance. The remaining function will print out the results of the calculations
for the data.

The Boston.csv file will be read in by the program and will be parsed and set as
part of 2 different vectors, for both columns of data: rm and medv. Once parsed and
assigned into their respective vectors, the data is calculated for both vectors separately. 
The covariance and correlation is calculated using both vectors. Once 
finished, the program will print the results onto the console.
